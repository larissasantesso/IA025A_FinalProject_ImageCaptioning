# Image Captioning

In this project, a combination of Transformers was used to perform the Image Captioning task. The details are described below:
- :gear: Architecture: encoder-decoder type
    - 	Encoder: ViT ([An Image is Worth 16x16 Words](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2010.11929))
    - 	Decoder: T5 ([Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683))
- :framed_picture: Datasets:
    -   MS COCO Captions (for fine-tuning and quantitative evaluation)
    -   Cityscapes  (for qualitative evaluation) 
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Experiment tracking: Weights & Biases
